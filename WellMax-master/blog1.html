                Digital marketing is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of marketing activities done online. It
                can be difficult to know where to start when it comes to digital marketing because there are so many
                options available. In this blog post, we will discuss 7 types of digital marketing that are most
                commonly used by businesses. Also, we will provide an overview of each type of marketing and how it can
                be used to reach your target audience. So, let’s learn these digital marketing types before you hire a
                digital marketing agency for your business.</p>

            <h1 data-splitting><span class="number">1</span> Content Marketing</h1>

            <p>Content Marketing is one of the most popular and important types. People on the internet seek their
                desired information to solve their queries or meet their desires. When your brand provides them the
                authentic and high-quality content, you successfully gain their confidence. </p>

            <p>Then your brand will secure an exact position of authority in the marketplace. And you will be the top
                choice of the customer whenever they have to make a decision. This is all the game of content marketing.
            </p>
            <p>Generally, the content marketing’s process involves creating and sharing content that’s not just meant or
                planned to be promotional. It may use storytelling or information telling techniques to make your
                audience aware of the related content. You may also use it for multiple purposes like educating,
                inspiring, or even entertaining your users.</p>
            <h1 data-splitting><span class="number">2</span> Social Media Marketing</h1>

            <p>As the name suggests, this type of digital marketing uses social media sites to promote a product,
                content, item, and brand. It might be done by paying ads or organically. However, you can also be done
                both of them simultaneously by publishing your content on social media or creating ads.</p>

            <p>Social media marketing may require a lot of activities like social media advertising, influencer
                marketing, and video marketing. But one thing you have to remember is to select a more suitable and
                convenient social network for your brand, product or service, persona, or content. </p>
            <p>When using this platform for your digital marketing, you have the perk of getting closer to your audience
                and followers. You may also get validation from the public when they share your content of this type.
                Moreover, you can also use your social media accounts or networks as a direct communication source with
                your audience.
            </p>
            <h1 data-splitting><span class="number">3</span> Email Marketing </h1>


            <p>Many people assume that email marketing is dead, but emails still send many messages. More than 100
                billion emails are sent and received each day. In this type of digital marketing strategy, you can reach
                significant results. </p>

            <p>
                Email marketing is still one of the most important types for small businesses to get their targeted
                audience. It is the process of sending targeted messages or emails to your contacts via email. Like many
                other digital marketing strategies, the messages you send through them are not always for proportional
                purposes.</p>
            <p>
                Along with it, email marketing can be a powerful channel for getting engaged with your audience with
                valuable and unique content. It is one of the best ways to keep your subscribers up-to-date with useful
                and relevant content. Moreover, promoting products and items is also an effective plan if you care about
                the customer’s privacy and do not send spam. </p>

            <h1 data-splitting><span class="number">4</span> Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h1>

            <p>Search Engine Optimization is another very important and popular type of online marketing for your
                business platform. It is generally optimizing your digital content to bring more organic traffic from
                several search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. </p>

                pages, news stories, photos, videos, and other material can all be found in these organic results.</p>


            <h1 data-splitting><span class="number">5</span> Website Design </h1>

            <p>Nowadays, in digital marketing, a website is considered one of the most important platforms for a
                company. Whenever visitors search and reach your site, they start to make an impression of your brand in
                their minds.</p>
            <p>Your website will also let them know what they need or want to know about the services you provide. And
                what type of values you are offering to your customers. However, website design may include a lot of
                factors.</p>
            <p>The layout or design of your website will help the visitors determine what pages will be included and how
                they will move to them. In addition, the design of the site and content will also help the audience to
                better understand your business.</p>
            <p>Search engine optimization or SEO is a process that improves the ranking of your websites in search
                engines like Google and Bing. When your content is correctly optimized, your webpage will appear on the
                first page of search engines for specific keywords.</p>
            <p>
                When applying this type of digital marketing technique, keep your targeted audience in mind for which
                the content you share will be suitable. Your keyword research should be effective and focused on your
                advertisement targets’ needs and requirements.</p>
            <h1 data-splitting><span class="number">6</span> PPC</h1>

            <p>PPC is an abbreviation for “Pay-Per-Click,” which is paid through this type of digital marketing. It
                means that you have to pay to get your brand visible in front of people. PPC advertising helps you
                attain visibility and brand recognition in front of people searching online.</p>
            <p>You need to search for the right keywords to run PPC campaigns. After that, you set your bids for
                different keywords and set your budget. You need to send your audience on the relevant and persuasive
                landing page to generate leads and sales. </p>
            <p>
                Make sure to work on the landing pages before running a PPC campaign to achieve the desired results.</p>
            <h1 data-splitting><span class="number">6</span> Affiliate Marketing </h1>

            <p>Affiliate marketing is a type of digital marketing in which content makers get commission for every
                conversion they make. In other words, such types of content creators may work as a sales team for your
                business.
            </p>
            <p>They work in such a way by creating their original and relevant content and then mentioning your service
                or product using a link. Then if their followers or audience click to purchase, you have to pay them for
                each sale.</p>
            <p>
                One of the main benefits of this digital marketing is that you do not have to manage a big audience.
                Because you can easily reach the public built up by content creators. Same as in social media marketing,
                you just have to pick the influencers or producers that fit your demand along with your services and
                products.</p>
            <h1 data-splitting>Summing Up</h1>
